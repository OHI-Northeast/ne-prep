# Habitat Services

This goal aims to measure the extent of habitat services in the form of the amount of protection provided by marine and coastal habitats to coastal areas that people value, both inhabited (homes and other structures) and uninhabited (parks, special places, etc. and the presence of areas serving as carbon sinks.

Healthy habitats contribute to coastal protection from storm surge, flooding and sea level rise and are a key aspect of carbon storage. In the Northeast, this includes salt marsh and eelgrass habitats. Both of these habitats are also included in the Biodiversity - Habitats subgoal. We can use those same layers here. These habitats vary in their ability to protect against coastal storm surge so we apply a weighting scheme. Salt marsh is four times more protective than eelgrass in regards to coastal protection.
