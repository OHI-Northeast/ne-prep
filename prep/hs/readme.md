## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Habitat Services goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Habitat Services goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

The Habitat Services goal includes **Carbon Storage** and **Coastal Protection**. 

**Carbon Storage** measures the extent and condition of the natural coastal ecosystems that store large amounts of carbon in their roots, stems and leaves and sequester it for decades or centuries in the sediment. In the Northeast, these habitats consist of Salt Marsh and Eelgrass beds.

See the Carbon Storage data layer script [here](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/hs/carbon_storage.html).

**Coastal Protection** measures the condition and extent of ecological habitats that protect the coasts against storm waves and flooding. Habitats assessed include Salt Marsh and Eelgrass beds. Storm protection by coastal habitats saves lives, property and is worth billions of dollars each year.
