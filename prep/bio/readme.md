## Biodiversity

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Biodiversity goal.

This goal is made up of two sub-goals, **Habitats** and **Species**.

- `hab` folder contains all scripts and data for the habitat sub-goal.
- `spp` folder contains all scripts and data for the species sub-goal.
