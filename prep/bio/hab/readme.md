## Biodiversity: Habitats sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data layers for the Habitats sub-goal. 

Data layer prep:

### [Salt Marsh](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/bio/hab/salt_marsh.html)

### [Eelgrass](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/bio/hab/eelgrass_layer.html)

### [Offshore Habitats](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/bio/hab/offshore_habitats.html)

- `eelgrass.Rmd` uses spatial data from the Northeast Ocean Data Portal that identifies current and historic eelgrass beds in the region to create a single spatial dataset that is then used in `eelgrass_layer.Rmd`
- `figs` folder contain figures
- `data` folder contains data generated by scripts in this folder
