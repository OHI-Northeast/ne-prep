## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Mariculture sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Mariculture sub-goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment. Mariculture is a sub-goal of the Food Provision goal, which also includes Wild-Caught Fisheries.

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#food-provision).

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
