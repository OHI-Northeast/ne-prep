## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Aquaculture sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Aquaculture sub-goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment. Aquaculture is a sub-goal of the Food Provision goal, which also includes Wild-Caught Fisheries.

### [Production](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/mar/production.html)
- Since there is not a single database with regional aquaculture production data at the farm or state level, this layer was generated by combining multiple data sources. Production data is aggregated to the species and state level for all years 2005 - 2017.

### [Sustainability](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/mar/sustainability.html)
- The sustainability data layer comes from the Montery Bay Aquarium seafood watch database.

More information about this goal is available [here](https://github.com/OHI-Northeast/ne-prep/blob/gh-pages/prep/mar/description.md#aquaculture).

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.
