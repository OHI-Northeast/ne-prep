## Livelihoods

This folder describes the methods used to prepare the data layers for the Livelihoods sub-goal. This sub-goal makes up half of the Livelihoods and Economies goal.

Click on the layers to see data preparation:

### [Jobs](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/liv/jobs.html)

### [Wages](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/liv/wages.html)

- [`clean_noep_data`](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/liv/clean_noep_data.html) cleans up the National Ocean Economics Program data to be used in the Jobs, Wages and GDP layers.

- `figs` folder contain figures
- `data` folder contains data generated by scripts in this folder
- `int` folder holds intermediate data for jobs and wages that may be useful to examine how the layers are created. These are mainly saved here for possible use in the dashboard.
