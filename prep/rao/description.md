# Resource Access Opportunities

People value the ability to access coastal and ocean resources. Isolating what allows for this type of access is difficult, but a necessary component of humans relationship with the ocean. We isolated two key components; are people able to to go out on the water, and if they can, are the resources they seek available. This goal scores well when people can access the coastline, can afford to go boating, and fish are thriving and available in the ocean.

We include two measures of sense of place: the price of gas compared to wages, fish stock assessment sustainability, and regulatory of access points along the coast
