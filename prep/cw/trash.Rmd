## Summary

The trash layer is derived from [Ocean Conservancy data](https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/annual-data-release/)) on the pounds of trash collected on International Coastal Cleanup Day.

```{r setup, message = F, warning = F, reslts = 'hide'}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6, fig.path = 'figs/', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)

source('~/github/ne-prep/src/R/common.R')

library(tidyverse)
```

## Data Wrangling

This data was manually copied and pasted from the [Ocean Conservancy website](https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/annual-data-release/) as it is not provided in an easy to use format. The "raw" data is an excel file with one sheet for each year. There are also some weird issues like a mix of lower and uppercase letters for the states.

The data is filtered to only those states in our regions (NY to Maine) and I add in a column, `pounds_per_person` which calculates the total pounds per volunteer.

```{r read_data}
clean_func <- function(year) {
  
raw <- readxl::read_excel(file.path(dir_anx, "_raw_data/OceanConservancy/CoastalCleanup_Data.xlsx"), sheet = year) %>%
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year),
         state = tolower(.[[1]]),
         people = .[[2]],
         pounds = as.numeric(.[[3]])) %>% #for some reason one of the sheets was having pounds read in as character. forcing it to numeric here
  mutate(state_fix = 
           case_when(
             state == "new ampshire" ~ "new hampshire",
             state == "new  hampshire" ~ "new hampshire",
             state == "new ork" ~ "new york",
             state == "new  york" ~ "new york",
             state == "rhode  island" ~ "rhode island"
           ))  %>%
  mutate(State = ifelse(is.na(state_fix), state, state_fix)) %>%
  select(year, state = State, people, pounds) %>%
  filter(state %in% c("new york", "connecticut", "maine", "massachusetts", "rhode island", "new hampshire")) %>%
  mutate(pounds_per_person = pounds/people)

return(raw)
}

years <- as.character(c(2006:2017)) #need to be characters to use years as sheet names in read_excel

out <- map_df(years, clean_func) 
```

## Visualize data

```{r pounds_pp_per_rgn}
ggplot(out, aes(x = year, y = pounds_per_person, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Pounds per person",
       title = "Pounds of trash collected on International Coastal Cleanup Day",
       color = "State")
```

## Save layer for toolbox

I need to attach region ID's to each row. All states except Massachusetts match up to a region. Since this data is not broken down to a coarser resolution, both MA regions will get the same score. I also add the offshore regions 1:4 with NA values for the toolbox to run. 

```{r save_layer}
rgns <- rgn_data %>%
  data.frame() %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

out %>%
  left_join(rgns) %>%
  select(year, rgn_id, pounds_pp = pounds_per_person) %>%
  complete(rgn_id = 1:11, #this adds in regions 1-4 with NA values for pounds_pp
           year) %>%
  write.csv(file.path(dir_calc, "layers/cw_trash.csv"))
```
