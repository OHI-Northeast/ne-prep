#Data details
##Jamie Afflerbach

- `ma_beaches.csv` was created in `pathogens.Rmd` and lists the Massachusetts beaches in Plymouth and Barnstable Counties.
- `ma_beachs_rgn_id.csv` takes `ma_beaches.csv` and adds the appropriate rgn id (7 or 8) depending on where the beach is located. The `rgn_id` column was added manually by Jamie.
