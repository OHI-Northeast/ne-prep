## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Clean Waters goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Clean Waters goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

Four data layers are used in the Clean Waters goal. Click on a layer to see data preparation:

#### [Pathogens](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/cw/pathogens.html)
- This layer is derived from [EPA Beach Closure](https://watersgeo.epa.gov/beacon2/) data.   

#### [Trash](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/cw/trash.html)
- The trash layer is derived from [Ocean Conservancy International coastal cleanup day data](https://oceanconservancy.org/trash-free-seas/international-coastal-cleanup/annual-data-release/).

#### [Water Quality Index](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/cw/water_quality_index.html)
- This layer is derived from the EPA's [National Coastal Condition Assessment Water Quality Index data](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/ncca)

#### [Sediment Quality Index](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/cw/sediment_quality_index.html)
- This layer is derived from the EPA's [National Coastal Condition Assessment Sediment Quality Index data](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/ncca).
