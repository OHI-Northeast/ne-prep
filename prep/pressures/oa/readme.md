## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Fishing Pressure

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for ocean acidification data layer that is a part of the climate change pressure layer calculation for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

#### OA Pressure data comparisons
- This layer compares two data sources. ___ is the OA data used for the global assessment, and ___ is another OA data source specifically looking at the Western Atlantic Ocean. Some GIFs were created in this markdown for visual comparison, and are located in the comparison GID folder.

#### [pressure_layer_oa_prep](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/pressures/oa/pressure_layer_oa_prep.html)
- This layer is derived from the ___ data source that we decided to use after doing a data comparison. The pressure score due to ocean acidification is calculated here.
