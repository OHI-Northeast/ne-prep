## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Sea Level Rise Pressure

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Sea Level Rise pressure layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.
