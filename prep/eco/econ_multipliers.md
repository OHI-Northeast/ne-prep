Hi Jamie,

Just wanted to get you the information I promised regarding multipliers. Here's a description from NOEP:

The total economic role of a given industry in a given region is the sum of its direct, indirect, and induced activity. Using employment as an example, direct activity is the employment in the industry itself. Indirect employment is the employment in firms within the region who supply goods and services to the industry. Induced employment is the employment affected by the spending of the direct and indirect employment within the region for the purchases of food, cars, services, etc.

The total economic influence of a given industry's employment in a given region is thus defined as:
  
  Total Employment = Direct Employment + Indirect Employment + Induced Employment.
  
  The sum of indirect and induced employment is referred to as the "multiplier." Total employment may thus also be defined as:
    
    Total Employment = Direct employment * multiplier
  
  Where the multiplier = 1 + (Indirect + Induced Employment) 
  Direct Employment
  
  The same equivalency can be defined for wages and GDP. The relationship between direct activity and total economic influence is defined as the multiplier effect.
  
  The multiplier effect can be estimated a number of different ways. NOEP uses a regional economic model called IMPLAN, which is commonly used for this type of analysis in a large number of settings. Multiplier effects are calculated for all OceanEconomy sectors and industries at the state and national level.
  
  Note that except in the specific data series labeled as "multipliers," all employment, wage, and GDP data in the NOEP market database refer to direct employment, wages, and GDP.
  
  So I would imagine that the data that Pat sent along does not include multipliers, but it might be worth checking directly with him when we move on to the LE goal and getting those values from him as well.
