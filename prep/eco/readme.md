## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Economies sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Economies sub-goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment. This sub-goal makes up half of the Livelihoods and Economies goal.

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#livelihoods-and-economies).


#### [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/eco/gdp.html)
- This layer is derived from [National Ocean Economic Program](http://www.oceaneconomics.org/) data that has been cleaned with the [`clean_noep_data`](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/liv/clean_noep_data.html) in the Livelihoods goal folder.

The `int` folder holds intermediate gdp data that may be useful to examine how the layer is created. This is saved here for possible use in the dashboard.


Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
