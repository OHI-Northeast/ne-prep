## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Economies sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Economies sub-goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment. This sub-goal makes up half of the Livelihoods and Economies goal.

More information about this goal is available [here](http://ohi-science.org/goals/#livelihoods-and-economies).

The `gdp.Rmd` script creates the gdp data layer from NOEP data. The NOEP data is cleaned with [this script](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/liv/clean_noep_data.html) and held in the Livelihoods [data folder](https://github.com/OHI-Northeast/ne-prep/tree/gh-pages/prep/liv/data).

The `int` folder holds intermediate gdp data that may be useful to examine how the layer is created. This is saved here for possible use in the dashboard.


Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
