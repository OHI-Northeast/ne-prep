## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Sense of Place goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Sense of Place goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

This goal contains two sub-goals:

### Lasting Special Places

### Iconic Species

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
