## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Sense of Place goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Sense of Place goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

This goal contains three sub-goals:

### Lasting Special Places

Measures the protection and designation of important sites within state waters and along the coastline. 

### Iconic Species

Measures the extinction risk of species deemed important and iconic to the region (e.g. North Atlantic Right Whale, Lobster).

### Public Access

Measures how well the public can access the coast.

------

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
