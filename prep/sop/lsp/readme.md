## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Lasting Special Places sub-goal

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the Lasting Special Places sub-goal for the US Northeast OHI assessment.

We measure protection of both marine *and* terrestrial areas to quantify how well places of significance are being recognized, designated and protected.

## [Marine areas](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/sop/lsp/marine_area.html)
- Calculates the total marine area designated and/or protected within state waters.

## [Terrestrial areas](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/sop/lsp/land_area.html)
- Calcluates the total area of land designated and/or protected within 1 km of the coastline.

The folders in this file include the metadata, R scripts, and data for each assessement year (i.e., the year the assessment was conducted).  The most current year represents the best available data and methods, and previous years are maintained for archival purposes.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
