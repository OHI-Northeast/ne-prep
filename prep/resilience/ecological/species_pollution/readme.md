## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Species Pollution Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the species pollution resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Data used:
Regualtions
1. Ballast Water Management Regulations
2. Aquaculture Policies and Regulations

Implementation and Enforcement; Effectiveness and Compliance
3. NAS USGS  

#### Ballast Water Management Regulations
- This layer is manually created with every region receiving a perfect score of 1 because of the implementation of mandatory Ballast Water Management Plans to enter ports since 2004

#### Aquaculture Policies and Regulations
- This layer is manually created with every region receiving a perfect score of 1 because of there is a permitting process for aquaculture. Once aquaculture regulations becomes analyzed in a comparable way across regions new data can be used in this area.

#### [NAS USGS](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/species_pollution/nas.html)
- This layer is derived from [NAS USGS national data](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/)
