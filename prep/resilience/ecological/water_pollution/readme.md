## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Water Pollution Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the water pollution resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Regulations:
1. EPA 

Implementation and Enforcement:
2. Discharge Facilities Inspected
3. DMR Submitted

Effectiveness and Compliance:
4. Discharge Facilities Violations

#### EPA
- This layer is manually created because the EPA has many regulations for water pollution

#### [Discharge Facilities Inspected](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/water_pollution/facilities_inspected.html)
- This layer is derived from the [EPA ECHO Database] (https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads)

#### [DMR Submitted](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/water_pollution/reports_submitted.html)
- This layer is derived from the [EPA ECHO Database] (https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads)

#### [Discharge Facilities Violationss](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/water_pollution/facilities_violations.html)
- This layer is derived from the [EPA ECHO Database] (https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads)
