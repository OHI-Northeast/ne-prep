# Data

**Reference**: EPA ECHO database https://echo.epa.gov/tools/data-downloads 

1. ICIS-NPDES National Data Set 
  a. ICIS_FACILITIES.csv
  b. NPDES_INSPECTIONS.csv
  c. NPDES_QNCR_HISTORY.csv

2. Permit Limit and DMR Data by Jurisdiction

**Downloaded**: July, 2019

**Description**:  

4 metrics included in the calculation:
1. Presence or absence of water discharge regulation 
2. Score between 0-1 for inspections of discharge facilities 
3. Score between 0-1 for discharge facilitiy violation 
4. Score between 0-1 for submissions of discharge monitoring reports (DMR)

Target = EPA established ‘National Goals’: 
1. 50% for inspector coverage 
2. 95% for monitoring report submission (DMR)
3. 0% for compliance violations.

**Time range**: Data provided annually for each source

1. ICIS-NPDES National Data Set 
  a. ICIS_FACILITIES.csv: no date range
  b. NPDES_INSPECTIONS.csv: 1967-2019
  c. NPDES_QNCR_HISTORY.csv:1973-2019

2. Permit Limit and DMR Data by Jurisdiction: 2009-2019


**Format**:  CSV file

##Violations

Note: not differentiating between types of violations (of which there are 4)
