## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Climate Change Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the climate change resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Data used:
1. American Council for Energy-Efficient Economy rankings
2. Climate Friendly Actions 
3. Renewable Energy Consumption 
4. Carbon Emissions 


#### [American Council for Energy-Efficient Economy rankings](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/acee_rankings.html)
- This layer is derived from [ACEE ranking](from https://database.aceee.org/state-scorecard-rank)

#### [Climate Friendly Actions](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/climate_action.html)
- This layer is derived from a list of climate friendly actions consolidated by [America's Pledge Report] (https://www.bbhub.io/dotorg/sites/28/2017/11/AmericasPledgePhaseOneReportWeb.pdf)

#### [Renewable Energy Consumption](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/renew_consum.html)
- This layer is derived from [EIA energy consumption data](https://www.eia.gov/beta/states/states/ny/data/dashboard/total-energy)

#### [Carbon Emissions](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/carbon_em.html)
- This layer is derived from [EPA carbon emissions data](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-09/documents/co2ffc_2015.pdf)

### [Climate Change Resilience Layer Calculations](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/res_climate_change.html)
- This layer pulls in scores calculated from each data source and calculates climate change resilience scores
