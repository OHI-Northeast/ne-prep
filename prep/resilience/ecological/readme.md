## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Categories of resilience layers:
1) Water Pollution
2) Fishing Pressure (biomass removal)
3) Climate Change
4) Habitat Destruction
5) Species Pollution

#### [Water Pollution Resilience](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/water_pollution.html)
- This layer is derived from [EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO)](https://echo.epa.gov) data.

#### [Fishing Pressure Resilience](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure.html)
- The stock layers are derived from NOAA stock assessment data and the [RAM legacy database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/)
- The protected areas layers are derived from [USGS Protected Area Database](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/pad-us-data-overview?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)
- The enforcement and compliance layers are derrived from NOAA Office of Law Enforcement Annual Reports and NOAA Fisheries Observer Program data 

**Note** 

All data from NOAA, for both catch and stock assessments, was provided via email. While NOAA does maintain an online database for landings, it is presented as an aggregated landings database - to the state level. We used disaggregated landings data that is more spatially explicit.
