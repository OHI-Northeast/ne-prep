## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Water pollution resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the water pollution resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 


#### [Gross Domestic Product (GDP)](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/water_pollution.html)
- This layer is derived from [EPA Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO)](https://echo.epa.gov) data.


The `int` folder holds intermediate gdp data that may be useful to examine how the layer is created. This is saved here for possible use in the dashboard.


Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
