## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Climate Change Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the climate change resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Regulations:
1. Fish Landed with Stock Assessments
2. Protected Areas
3. Stocks Adequately Assessed
4. Species Regulated

Implementation and Enforcement:
5. OLE Actions
6. Fisheries Observers

Effectiveness and Compliance:
7. OLE Actions

Effectiveness and Compliance
- Same data as implementation and enforcement

#### [Fish Landed with Stock Assessments](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/stock_assessed.html)
- The stock layers are derived from NOAA stock assessment data and the [RAM legacy database](https://www.ramlegacy.org/)

#### [Protected Areas](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/fish_area_protected.html)
- The protected areas layers are derived from [USGS Protected Area Database](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/science-analytics-and-synthesis/gap/science/pad-us-data-overview?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

#### [Stocks Adequatly Assessesd](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/adeq_assessed.html)
- This layer is derived from NOAA stock assessment data and fisheries landings data

#### [Species Regulated](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/species_regulated.html)
- This layer is derived from a list of species historically landed that have any management or regulation

#### NOAA OLE Actions [Enforcement](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_enforce.html) [Compliance](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_compliance.html)
- This layer is derived from NOAA Office of Law Enforcement reports emailed to us 

#### [Fisheries Observers](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/obser_cov.html)
- This layer is derived NOAA fisheries observer data emailed to us

**Note** 
All data from NOAA, for catch, stock assessments, OLE, and observer, was provided via email. While NOAA does maintain an online database for landings, it is presented as an aggregated landings database - to the state level. We used disaggregated landings data that is more spatially explicit.

Please see our [citation policy](http://ohi-science.org/citation-policy/) if you use OHI data or methods.

Thank you!
