## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Habitat Destruction Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the habitat destruction resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Data used:
1. Habitat Areas Protected
2. Surfrider State of the Beach Report
3. NOAA OLE Actions

#### [Surfrider State of the Beach Reports](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/climate_action.html)
- This layer is derived from [Surfrider State of the Beach Report](https://www.surfrider.org/coastal-blog/entry/2017-state-of-the-beach-report)

#### [NOAA OLE Actions](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_enforce.html)
(https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_compliance.html)
- This layer is derived from reports emailed to us by Casey Brennan (casey.brennan@noaa.gov) from the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement
