## Ocean Health Index - US Northeast: Habitat Destruction Resilience

This folder describes the methods used to prepare data for the habitat destruction resilience layer for the US Northeast OHI assessment. 

Reguations:
1. Habitat Areas Protected
2. Surfrider State of the Beach Report

Implementation and Enforcement:
3. NOAA OLE Actions

Effectiveness and Compliance:
- The same data as Implementation and Enforcement

- This layer is derived from [NOAA Greater Atlantic Fisheries](https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/educational_resources/gis/data/)

#### [Surfrider State of the Beach Reports](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/climate_change/climate_action.html)
- This layer is derived from [Surfrider State of the Beach Report](https://www.surfrider.org/coastal-blog/entry/2017-state-of-the-beach-report)

#### NOAA OLE Actions [Enforcement](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_enforce.html) [Compliance](https://ohi-northeast.github.io/ne-prep/prep/resilience/ecological/fishing_pressure/ole_compliance.html)
- This layer is derived from reports emailed to us by Casey Brennan (casey.brennan@noaa.gov) from the NOAA Office of Law Enforcement
