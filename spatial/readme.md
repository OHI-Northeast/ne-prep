Hi Jamie and Courtney,
 
Thanks for a helpful call today.  I’ve attached a shapefile which shows our approximate planning area, but as I mentioned on the phone, it was really only used for visualization purposes for our rec uses study, and it’s not officially endorsed by NROC or the NE RPB.  We based its boundaries off of the continental shelf and the EEZ, so it covers a pretty wide area, and also extends a bit on to land, so it will probably need to be modified down the road, but should be a good starting point for now. 
 
          Kate
